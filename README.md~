Functional Genomics Final Project Source Code

Project based on data from 
"Gene Expression Profiling in Breast Cancer: Understanding the
Molecular Basis of Histologic Grade To Improve Prognosis" -- Sotiriou et. al.

diffanalysis - Nearest Centroid Assignment for primary breast cancer tumor grades
based on top 49 differentially expressed genes in grade 1 and 3 tumors as identified
by the CLEAN algorithm available on genomicsportals.org
KMeans - kmeans centroid clustering and nearest centroid assignment for primary breast cancer tumor grades
PLSR = projection to latent space predictor for primary breast cancer tumor grades
test.cdt - grade 1 and 3 tumors and 49 top differentially expressed gene 
expression per sample
test.cdt - grade 2 tumors and 49 top differentially expressed genes from grade 1 and 3
tumors, expression per sample
