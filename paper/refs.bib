abstract ={Background: Histologic grade in breast cancer provides clinically important prognostic information. However, 30%–60% of tumors are classified as histologic grade 2. This grade is associated with an intermediate risk of recurrence and is thus not informative for clinical decision making. We examined whether histologic grade was associated with gene expression profiles of breast cancers and whether such profiles could be used to improve histologic grading. Methods: We analyzed microarray data from 189 invasive breast carcinomas and from three published gene expression datasets from breast carcinomas. We identified differentially expressed genes in a training set of 64 estrogen receptor (ER)–positive tumor samples by comparing expression profiles between histologic grade 3 tumors and histologic grade 1 tumors and used the expression of these genes to define the gene expression grade index. Data from 597 independent tumors were used to evaluate the association between relapse-free survival and the gene expression grade index in a Kaplan–Meier analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We identified 97 genes in our training set that were associated with histologic grade; most of these genes were involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. In validation datasets, the gene expression grade index was strongly associated with histologic grade 1 and 3 status; however, among histologic grade 2 tumors, the index spanned the values for histologic grade 1–3 tumors. Among patients with histologic grade 2 tumors, a high gene expression grade index was associated with a higher risk of recurrence than a low gene expression grade index (hazard ratio = 3.61, 95% confidence interval = 2.25 to 5.78; P<.001, log-rank test). Conclusions: Gene expression grade index appeared to reclassify patients with histologic grade 2 tumors into two groups with high versus low risks of recurrence. This approach may improve the accuracy of tumor grading and thus its prognostic value.},

abstract ={Comprehensive gene expression patterns generated from cDNA microarrays were
 correlated with detailed clinico-pathological characteristics and clinical
 outcome in an unselected group of 99 node-negative and node-positive breast
 cancer patients. Gene expression patterns were found to be strongly associated
 with estrogen receptor (ER) status and moderately associated with grade, but
 not associated with menopausal status, nodal status, or tumor size.
 Hierarchical cluster analysis segregated the tumors into two main groups based
 on their ER status, which correlated well with basal and luminal
 characteristics. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified 16
 genes that were significantly associated with relapse-free survival at a
 stringent significance level of 0.001 to account for multiple comparisons. Of
 231 genes previously reported by others [van't Veer, L. J., et al.
 (2002) Nature 415, 530-536] as being associated with survival, 93
 probe elements overlapped with the set of 7,650 probe elements represented on
 the arrays used in this study. Hierarchical cluster analysis based on the set
 of 93 probe elements segregated our population into two distinct subgroups
 with different relapse-free survival (P < 0.03). The number of
 these 93 probe elements showing significant univariate association with
 relapse-free survival (P < 0.05) in the present study was 14,
 representing 11 unique genes. Genes involved in cell cycle, DNA replication,
 and chromosomal stability were consistently elevated in the various poor
 prognostic groups. In addition, glutathione S-transferase M3 emerged
 as an important survival marker in both studies. When taken together with
 other array studies, our results highlight the consistent biological and
 clinical associations with gene expression profiles.},

abstract ={The purpose of this study was to classify breast carcinomas based on variations in gene expression patterns derived from cDNA microarrays and to correlate tumor characteristics to clinical outcome. A total of 85 cDNA microarray experiments representing 78 cancers, three fibroadenomas, and four normal breast tissues were analyzed by hierarchical clustering. As reported previously, the cancers could be classified into a basal epithelial-like group, an ERBB2-overexpressing group and a normal breast-like group based on variations in gene expression. A novel finding was that the previously characterized luminal epithelial/estrogen receptor-positive group could be divided into at least two subgroups, each with a distinctive expression profile. These subtypes proved to be reasonably robust by clustering using two different gene sets: first, a set of 456 cDNA clones previously selected to reflect intrinsic properties of the tumors and, second, a gene set that highly correlated with patient outcome. Survival analyses on a subcohort of patients with locally advanced breast cancer uniformly treated in a prospective study showed significantly different outcomes for the patients belonging to the various groups, including a poor prognosis for the basal-like subtype and a significant difference in outcome for the two estrogen receptor-positive groups.},
